               <h2>The Odin Project</h2>
               <p id="testP">
                  "The Odin Project (TOP) was one of my first introduction into coding and web development. 
                  Before TOP, I was basically searching the web for different websites and browsing around looking
                  for affordable and legit coding camps. I drove Uber for extra and one day I got a rider from UPenn.
                  We chatted for a little bit and it came about that he was studying computer science. I told him about
                  my interest and he recommended TOP to see if I would be ok with learning on my own or would need a 
                  little structure before I paid for a bootcamp. TOP worked out for a little but they really provide you
                  with no one on one help. It's legit a learn on your own but we will give you everything you need to know.
                  I worked on a few projects and realized that a structured setting where I could ask peers and staff questions
                  when something didn't make sense."

               <h2>Comptia</h2>
               <p>
                  I explored Comptia certifications a little bit as I entertained the idea of becoming a network engineer
                  and just getting a foot in the door as an entry level help desk support guy. I bought several of their 
                  books and was getting ready to start studying but realized my passion wasnt for network configurations
                  and help desk.

               <h2>Khan Academy</h2>
               <p>
                  The Khan Academy was a mini project something I explored that offered coding as well. I took the 
                  course on SQL and began learning to write querys. I only used it for about 2 days before I became bored
                  as it was very simple to learn.

               <h2>Drexel</h2>
               <p>
                  I started my masters in Information Systems at Drexel when I learning that my Job paid for 40% of the tuition.
                  Drexel masters program doesn't really teach you coding but more of the theories and architecture of
                  systems development and engineering. Some of the courses do have you code but they dont expect you to be 
                  an expert coder. Most of the coding is basic syntax and you are walked through it just so you understand
                  the assignments. I am currently still in the masters program and took entirely too many courses this term.

               <h2>Code Academy</h2>
               <p>
                  Ads for Code Academy kept popping up in my feeds and emails so I decided to take a look at it. They also 
                  offered a discount on their courses. At this time I became interested in data analytics and they 
                  offered a program in data science. I finished the first section and then was accepted into Launch Code.

               <h2>LaunchCode</h2>
               <p>
                  LaunchCode was probably the best decision I've made since my coding journey began. I learned about it from 
                  an Instagram ad and took the premliminary test not expecting to be accepted. I took 3 courses this term
                  and it was too late to withdraw when I found out I was accepted. So this term has been hectic but, I 
                  learn everyday that LaunchCode will be the difference maker in my coding journey.
